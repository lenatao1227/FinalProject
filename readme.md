# MSTU 5003 Design Document -Ziyun Tao
## Topic
The topic of my website is to encourage people share photos and learn in my website. The webpage will include some main functions:
    a. Share your photographs and get feedback
Registered users can post their work on our websites, and there are “likes” and “dislikes” button for others to judge.（If you choose “dislike”, you need also choose a reason like ”the composition is not good”, “the light is not enough” you can also write a comment on the photograph so both of you can learn from a “non-good” work)

    b. Sell your works to whom need them
This is the part that encourage people to share their work, and they can price their work by add a minimum price on it, and people who want to use this photograph can buy it and have the right to use this photo.
There is also an area to report of plagiarism.(I think it is very important to protect the copyright)

    c. Learning from peer review, learning courses and discussion forum
We provide specific place for people to ask questions and learn from each other, there are also learning material for them to know some photograph skills. Therefore people can learn photography and get feedback in my websites.

## Problem
I found the content or functions of some sharing websites are too complicate for people who like photography. (Like tumblr, users can upload text, photo, video, link and also chat online). So I would like to create a more simple one with clear category and only include text and photographs).
Other websites are too professional for starters or amateur photographers(like https://www.eyeem.com). So my website is more simple and for a small group of people who want to improve their skills and share their work(and get paid).

## Target Audience
This website is a sharing place for amateur photographers and people who want to be photographers. People can upload their works and get some suggestions and reward.
